PotHix dotfiles
===============

This repository holds all my "dotfiles" with personal configurations for a lot
of different softwares that I use.

My dotfiles are organized in modules using the
[dot-install](https://github.com/dgvncsz0f/dot-install) project. You should use
any of this modules separately.

To install a module:

        $ sh <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/dgvncsz0f/dot-install/master/dot-install) repo=git://github.com/PotHix/pothix-dotfiles.git module=editor/vim

This command  will install my vimfiles on your home folder.

For more informations about the dot-install project just read its
[README](https://github.com/dgvncsz0f/dot-install).
